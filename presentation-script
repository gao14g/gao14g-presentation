Hello, my name is Ga Kay Gao, and I'm here to talk to you about video games. If you are like me, you grew up with video games all around you.
My cousins owned almost every type of video game system imaginable, and since I always hung out with them, I was always playing some kind of 
game. For some people, video games was a way to escape the real world. You could be anybody you wanted to be. You could be a fighter, a chef,
a spy, an assassin; the list goes on. 

In this century where technology is growing so rapidly and more and more people are sitting in front of TV and computer screens, video games
have become a very popular source of entertainment. In the present, we have what I like to call "Modern Games". These types of games are 
characterized by high-detailed graphics, in-depth story lines, a captivating soundtrack, and often a lot of violence. Some popular games out
right now are Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, and Grand Theft Auto. Games like these have be praised for their high level of graphic details, 
but games haven't always been this way. If we take it back 20-30 years, games looked extremely different. I like to call these games "Old School
or Retro Games". These are the games that can only be played on older consoles and are characterized by 8-bit graphics, 8-bit soundtracks,
clunky controls, and sometimes a short storyline. Keep in mind that the technology available back then was limited, and games of this era were
amazing to the video game community. Some popular titles you may recognize are Legend of Zelda, Punch-Out!!, and Mario Kart 64.

All of these games, both modern and old school, are amazing in their own way, but where did all this actually begin? What was the very first 
video game? These have been many debates on this which has caused of a lot of uncertainty about the answer to these questions. Every single 
person has their own definition of what is classified as a "video game" so it's hard to say that one is more right than the other, but there
has been one particular game that has become popular, and that game is called Tennis for Two. Tennis for Two was first introducted on October 
18, 1958 by creater William Higinbotham on one of the lab's visitors' days. Higinbotham was a nuclear physicist and decided that previous science
exhibits were too boring. He wrote, "it might liven up the place to have a game that people could play, and which would convey the message that 
our scientific endeavors have relevance for society". Tennis for Two was a fairly simple idea. Two people had separate controllers that were both
hooked up to an anolog computer that used on oscillscope for a screen. The ball was brightly lit and would move side to side on the screen across
both sides of the net. Players could use the buttons on the controllers to serve and volley the ball and the rotating dials to control the angle
of the invisible tennis racket. After the creation of Tennis for Two, hundreds of people lined up to play one of the first video games. Higinbotham
might have created this game merely as entertainment for the exhibit's visitors, but little did he know, his creation would lead to the start of 
the video game industry.

After the creation of this game, games like Pong and Mario came out, which would eventually lead to the creation of game systems. Game system were
split up into generations. The first generation was from 1972-1976. Unlike game systems today, the first gen game systems actually came with their
respective games instead of having to buy each one seperately. They were often characterized by the entire game being on one screen, basic lines 
and dots, single-channel or even no audio, and black and white graphics.
